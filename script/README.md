# Quantitative evaluation for comparing motion magnification methods

Many motion magnification methods train their models using the training data proposed by ["Oh, Tae-Hyun, et al., "Learning-based video motion magnification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02684), ECCV, 2018", but the evaluation data for quantitative assessment presented in that paper has not been made publicly available.

Therefore, we release the evaluation dataset for quantitative comparison of motion magnification methods, strictly following the methods presented in that papers.
